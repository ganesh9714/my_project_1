Code Explanation

1. **Import Statements**:
   
   ```python
   import schedule
   import time
   from datetime import datetime
   import threading
   ```

   - These are the import statements for the necessary modules used in the code:
     - `schedule`: A Python library for scheduling tasks.
     - `time`: Provides time-related functions.
     - `datetime`: Provides date and time functionality.
     - `threading`: Allows you to create and manage threads for running tasks concurrently.

2. **Global Variable `task_list`**:

   ```python
   task_list = []
   ```

   - This initializes an empty list to store task details.

3. **`create_task()` Function**:

   - This function allows the user to create a new task.
   - It takes user inputs for task name, time, and date.
   - It calculates the time difference between the specified task time and the current time.
   - It schedules the task using the `schedule.every().day.at(task_time).do(notify_task)` method, where `notify_task` is a function that will print a message when the task time arrives.
   - Task details are stored in `task_list`.

4. **`greeting()` Function**:

   - This function greets the user and asks how they are doing.

5. **`scheduling_permission()` Function**:

   - This function asks the user if they want to plan a new task.
   - If yes, it calls `create_task()`.
   - If no, it ends the program.

6. **`oth_services()` Function**:

   - This function offers additional services to the user, such as checking the number of pending tasks and canceling all tasks.
   - It provides options based on user input.

7. **`asking_user()` Function**:

   - This function allows the user to keep creating tasks until they decide to stop.
   - It uses a `while` loop and calls `create_task()` based on user input.

8. **Main Program**:

   - The main program starts with the `greeting()` function to greet the user.
   - Then, it calls `scheduling_permission()` to check if the user wants to create a task.
   - It offers other services using the `oth_services()` function.
   - Finally, it enters an infinite loop (`while True`) to keep the program running.
   
9. **Background Task Scheduling with Threads**:

   - Inside the `create_task()` function, a new thread is created to run `schedule.run_pending()` continuously in the background.
   - This ensures that tasks are executed in the background without blocking the main program.
   - The program will notify the user when a scheduled task's time arrives.
